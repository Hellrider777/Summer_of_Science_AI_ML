# Summer of Science AI/ML Capstone Project

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict GDP per capita using socio-economic indicators from the World Bank's World Development Index.

## Features

- Regression models: Lasso, Ridge, Polynomial, Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
- Ensemble methods: Random Forest, XGBoost
- Unsupervised learning: K-Means Clustering, One-Class SVM (anomaly detection)
- Feature importance and model evaluation

## Tools Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, pyGAM, XGBoost)
- Google Colab

## Dataset

- World Bank World Development Index (multiple socio-economic indicators)

## Results

- XGBoost achieved the best RÂ² score (0.88)
- Key predictors: Life Expectancy, Internet Usage, Female Labor Participation, Education Expenditure
